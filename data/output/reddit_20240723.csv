But our team needs to do a lot of self-service and so we rely mostly on PySpark for doing our jobs (on EMR typically). For a very long time I have been interested in having our jobs orchestrated, with the thought that it would likely be Airflow. Suffice it to say that in recent weeks I have gone down a bit of rabbit hole and finally decided we need to make the plunge and build out our automation. I have chosen to go with Dagster over Airflow (which btw, I have used in the past for personal projects and know fairly well) and have also been playing around with DuckDB and immediately felt like it could be a game changer for our flows. So Dagster and DuckDB seems like a great combo for most of the data pipelines we run. 

And this brings me to the question at hand. I have looked at dlt and dbt as tools that could potentially be added to this stack, but in either case it's not clear to me exactly what they are bringing to the table that can't be done by Dagster+DuckDB without adding extra complexity. Am I missing something? What are the use cases where dlt and or dbt are helpful, if not critical to the modern data stack? Is it more about scaling?

1e9cqm8,Trilogy - An [Experimental] Accessible SQL Semantic Layer,"Hey all - looking for feedback on an attempt to simplify SQL for some parts of data engineering, with the up-front acknowledgement that trying to replace SQL is generally a bad idea. 

SQL is great. Trilogy is an open-source attempt simplify *data warehouse* SQL (reporting, analytics, dashboards, ETL, etc) by augmenting core SQL syntax with a lightweight semantic binding layer that removes the need for FROM/JOIN clause(s).

It's a simple authoring framework for PK/FK definition that enables automatic traversal at query time with the ability to define reusable calculations - without requiring you to drop into a different language to modify the semantic layer, so you can iterate rapidly.

Queries look like SQL, but operate on 'concepts', a reusable semantic definition that can include a calculation on other concepts. Root concepts are bound to the actual warehouse via datasource definitions which associate them with columns on tables.

At query execution time, the compiler evaluates if the selected concepts can be resolved from the semantic layer by recursively sourcing all inputs of a given concept, and automatically infers any joins required and builds the relevant SQL to execute against a given backend (presto, bigquery, snowflake, etc). The query engine operating one level of abstraction up enables a lot of efficiency optimization - if you materialize a derived concept, it can be immediately referenced by a followup query without requiring recalculation, for example.

The semantic layer can be imported/reused, including reusable CTEs/concept definitions, and ported across dbs or refactored to new tables by just updating the root datasource bindings.

Goals are:

* Decouple business logic from the storage layer in the warehouse to enable them to evolve separately - don't worry about breaking your user queries when you refactor your model
* Simplify syntax where possible and have it encourage ""doing the right thing""
* Maintain acceptable performance/generate reasonable SQL for a human to read

1e97o71, Best practices for handling replicated data from RDS to Redshift  for DBT workflows,"Hello,   
I'm currently working in a new project which uses Redshift as a DWH., and there is a DMS in the background that is replicating data from MySQL RDS to Redshift. 

I have a task to introduce DBT technology for Transformations on Redshift. And I have some questions/concerns.  
  
When replicating data from RDS to Redshift, I'm wondering about the best approach to handle this data in my dbt workflow. I'm considering two options and would appreciate your insights:

Treat replicated tables as raw/untouchable source data:

* Keep the replicated data unchanged
* Run DBT workflows which basically are coping (maybe some little changes) these tables to new tables in my target ""dbt"" schema - and at this stage add dist keys, sortkeys to copied table. Let's call it my staging layer - but with table materializations
* Create next layers based on these tables: intermediate/marts etc

Modify the raw replicated tables:

* Add distkey and sortkey directly to the raw replicated tables in Redshift
*  Still use dbt for further transformations and modeling, but in these casse treat ""replicated tables"" as my source data that is already prepared,and  modified for  staging layer.

So in the end I wonder if it's okey to touch replicated tables and build on top of them, or better to leave them untouched and just copy them in proper form into new base layer for my dbt workflows.

Which approach is generally considered best practice? Are there scenarios where one might be preferred over the other?

Additionally, if I go with the second approach, how can I automate the process of adding or updating distkey and sortkey for newly replicated tables in Redshift?

I'd appreciate any advice, especially from those who have experience with similar setups. Thanks in advance!",3,2,Purple_Wrap9596,2024-07-22 06:48:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1e97o71/best_practices_for_handling_replicated_data_from/,0.81,False,False,False,False,0,
1e9rb78,How would you architect and/or orchestrate this with Airflow/Cloud Composer?,"**Current State:**

Several buckets in GCS are mirrored to SFTP servers that partners/vendors/clients drop files into.  Each new file drop kicks off a cloud function that checks against a list of ""configs"" and loads the data raw into big query.  This system has been humming along for about a year with no issue.

A config looks something like this:

    GenericDatafile(
        datafile_name=""CandidateV1"",
        report_name=ReportNames.CANDIDATE,
        file_match_regex=r""Candidate \(C3\)_\d\d\d\d\d\d\d\d\.csv"",
        destination_dataset=""raw_candidate_reports"",
        destination_table=""candidate_v1"",
        file_ext=""csv"",
        delimiter="","",
        datamodel=CandidateModelV1,
        uuid_enrichment=True,
        skip_top_rows=0,
        skip_bottom_rows=0,
        custom_parser=None,
    )

We have a series of DBT jobs and downstream processes that run off of the DBT'd data.  Right now they are all run via crons.  

We knew this wasn't the ideal solution, but given bandwidth and implementation timelines for the downstream processes, this is what we did.

**Problems:**

1) As we add new partners, crons are not going to cut it for management of DBT runs and additional downstream processes

2) Observability and monitoring is fractured across many systems

3) We run on DBT cloud now and we'd like to move away from it for various reasons

4) We are expanding the scope of the downstream processes and certain files need to trigger certain DBT runs and also certain downstream processes (generally other cloud functions or API calls)

**Proposed Solution(s):**

We're planning to move to GCP's managed Airflow, Cloud Composer.  

1) Keep config-based extract/load system outside of Airflow and add an attribute to the config like \`run\_dag\` that would kick off a given DAG via the Airflow REST API

2) Move config-based extract/load system into Airflow

**Concerns/Problems:**

I have a slight preference for option 2 here for observability and monitoring reasons.  Generally, when our systems fail it is because partners/vendors/clients send bad data that does not conform to the agreed upon spec (column name changes, column reordering, unexpected values for very strict enum type cols, etc.).  Depending on the category of data error things can fail and the extract/load step, dbt steps or down stream process steps.  For this reason, I think it would be great if \_everything\_ was run in airflow for isolating and triaging failures.

My issue with option 2 is the following (and maybe this isn't even a valid issue! i'm quite new to airflow):  As I have been spiking this, I can't figure out an elegant way to trigger certain DAGs, based on a regex match against a new file that was uploaded.  

Right now, in my prototype I have a cloud function that runs whenever a file is uploaded to the bucket it is listening to and kicks off a DAG in airflow by refrencing the \`dag\_id\` -- it passes along the location of the file in the payload.  

In actuality we have about 10 buckets with 50 different files spread amonst them.  I'm not super keen on the idea of all files passing through one central ""starter"" dag and then using that dag to kick off other dags, buy maybe this is the way?  

My ideal scenario is all upload/dbt/downstream DAGS have their own isolated graph, but I have not come up with a good implementation for this while keeping everything in Airflow.

This is why option 1 is attractive (although not my preference for the observability reasons), because it's quite easy to attach an isolated dag to a config and have that get triggered.

Anyways! I would really appreciate any guidance on how to achieve my goals with option 2. In summary, you can imagine \~50 different files spread across 10 or so buckets, that need to trigger a specific set of steps based on a regex match for what the file is and I would love if each DAG is isolated from the others, instead of having everything be birthed from one ""starter"" DAG that would get kicked off whenever any inbound file triggers it.",3,1,__dog_man__,2024-07-22 22:22:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1e9rb78/how_would_you_architect_andor_orchestrate_this/,1.0,False,False,False,False,0,

How do you evaluate what you need in a data warehouse?

After helping many customers modernize their data stack,  Snowflake has become our DW of choice due to its simplicity in setting up and administering, but it may not be right for your organization.

**Here are some things we think should be considered:**

1️. How much data do you have?  Are you moving from a Google Sheets / Excel based process and you don't have that much data?

You might be fine with a simpler / less expensive option like DuckDB

2️. Can your company benefit from a data marketplace?

The Snowflake data marketplace is great for getting free and paid datasets, but if your need is just to use your own data, then this is not going to be of value.

3. Do you need to protect data for different types of users?

If your data is not that sensitive, they you will not get value from the robust Snowflake RBAC model where you can store all your data in one place while providing different levels of access to different types of users.

4️. Do you need to share data with partners?

If you don't need to share data with the simplicity you share a file on Google Drive / One Drive, then you may now need Snowflake.

5️. Do you like tinkering and tweaking things?

If you prefer to have all the knobs to tweak to your heart's content, then Snowflake may not be right for you. Snowflake prioritizes user experience which means you will not be able to tweak as many things as you can on other platforms. This is fine, to each their own 😁

1e9p3b4,Choosing a Cloud-Agnostic Metadata Store with Cross-Platform Querying,"
Hi everyone,

I'm researching metadata stores that can work seamlessly across multiple cloud providers (GCP, AWS, Azure) and data platforms (Snowflake, Databricks).

My key requirements are:

Broad Compatibility: I need a store that can catalog metadata from a wide range of sources, including data warehouses, data lakes, and even streaming platforms.
Cross-Platform Querying: The ability to query the metadata store directly from various platforms is essential. Ideally, I'd like to be able to run queries from Snowflake, Databricks, etc., without needing to move the metadata around.
API-Driven: A robust API is important for integration with other tools in my data ecosystem.
Example Use Case:

Let's say I have some data in BigQuery (GCP) and some in Snowflake. I'd like to be able to:

Store metadata about both datasets in the same metadata store.
Run a query from Snowflake that analyzes metadata about both the Snowflake and BigQuery data.
Do the same from BigQuery, querying metadata about both sources.
Has anyone had experience with a metadata store that meets these criteria? Any recommendations or insights would be greatly appreciated!",2,0,SeaworthinessDue8121,2024-07-22 20:51:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1e9p3b4/choosing_a_cloudagnostic_metadata_store_with/,0.76,False,False,False,False,0,
1e9klzp,How does AWS Glue distribute workloads across DPUs?,"I'm currently working on an AWS Glue job that loads data from a legacy relational database into Amazon Redshift. I'm trying to understand how AWS Glue distributes its workloads across Data Processing Units (DPUs).

My specific questions are:

1. Does AWS Glue automatically handle the distribution of workloads across DPUs, or is there any configuration required on my part?
2. Are there any best practices or tips for optimizing the use of DPUs in Glue jobs?

Any insights or resources you can share would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",2,1,naruto_believe12,2024-07-22 17:51:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1e9klzp/how_does_aws_glue_distribute_workloads_across_dpus/,0.67,False,False,False,False,0,
1e9q0k9,"What does ""Metadata Management"" Mean to you?","We hear the term ""Metadata Management"" used a lot but there are a lot of types of metadata.

\- User facing data about datasets (think data catalogs like colibra and alation)

\- metadata of datasets used to optimize queries at the engine level (Think Iceberg, Delta Lake, Hudi)

etc.  


When you think Metadata Management is one of the most important challenges, what do you think of it as?
